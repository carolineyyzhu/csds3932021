The Computer Science program of study builder (CSPOSB) allows users to explore the graduation requirements for both a BS and a BA in computer science at Case Western Reserve University. 
The website is composed of three parts: general degree information, schedule builder and requirements checker. The general information explains the requirements for each degree and is static.
The schedule builder allows for users to plan out their course of study by selecting classes for each semester and displays the created four year plan. This feature also certifies that the entered
schedule fulfills graduation requirements. The final feature allows for a student to check which degree requirements they do not meet and suggests classes to fufill that requirement.
